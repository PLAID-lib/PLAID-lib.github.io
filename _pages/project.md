# Physics-Learning AI Datamodel

PLAID (Physics-Learning AI Datamodel) is a flexible and extensible framework for representing and sharing datasets of physics simulations. PLAID defines a unified standard for describing simulation data and is accompanied by a library for creating, reading, and manipulating complex datasets across a wide range of physical use cases.
The data model and library have initially been developped at SafranTech, the research center of [Safran group](https://www.safran-group.com/).

# Open-data

At the heart of PLAID is the seemless exchange of dataset for streamlined collaboration. Six interactive benchmarks are provided in a [HuggingFace community](https://huggingface.co/PLAIDcompetitions). Corresponding datasets are provided in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/PLAID-datasets) as well, and in a [Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/plaid_datasets).

Each dataset comes with a visualization application, hosted as a Hugging Face space, for example:
